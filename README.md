Following the aim of each lab

Lab1
Write domain specific functions for given problems required for problem solving 
Create MoveGen and GoalTest Functions for the given problems
1. Water Jug ProblemThere are two jugs available of different volumessuch as a 3 litres and a 7 litres and you have to measure a different volume such as 6 litre.
2.Travelling Salesman ProblemA salesman is travelling and selling his/her product toin different cities. The condition is that it has to travel each city just once.
3. 8 Puzzle ProblemAn initial state is given in a 8 puzzle where one place is blank out of 9 places. You can shift this blank space and geta differentstateto reach to a given goal state.

Lab2
Select a problem from the following and implement DFID to find the path from start state to goal state. Analyse the Time and Space complexity. Comment on Optimality and completeness of the solution.
Problem 1: 8-Puzzle 

Lab3
Design any two different heuristics for a given blocks world problem and show that one is better than another using Hill Climbing and Best First Search

Lab4 
Solve the following SAT problems using VND
1.F = (AV ~B) ^ (B V ~C) ^ (~B) ^ (~C V E) ^ (A V C) ^ (~C V ~D)
2.F = ( A V B) ^ ( A ^ ~C) ^ ( B ^ D )^ ( A V ~E)

Lab5
1.Implement Genetic algorithm for 20 cities using Cyclic crossover and find the number of iterations where the algorithm converges.
2.Compare the performance of Genetic algorithm using 5, 10, 20 and 40 cities.
3.Compare the time and space complexityof genetic algorithm using cyclic and ordinal crossovers for 10 cities

Lab6
Solve the following Shortest Path Algorithm:
1. Consider 40 -45 geo locations between Juhu beach till Gateway of India. 5-8 locations not in the route and choice of location should keep in mind two different possible path.
2. Find the shortest path between Juhu beach till Gateway of India.
3. Use Havesine formula for distance calculation.

Lab7
